## Notes

Had some issues with installing a Mac OS onto a virtual machine that was up-to-date enough for me to download the most recent XCode from the App Store. Besides that, there were no issues with implementing the basic tip calculator. Also struggled with implementing locale and currency information, so did not implement in final solution.
